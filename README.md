# UI Designs
In this repo you can find some of my UI designs. This list will be updated probably as long as my portfolio website is not finished. These designs are often work in progress. All Figma protos can be viewed without logging in or downloading. Feedback on designs is appreaciated.


## *Limitless* - credit card company
The idea was to create a design of a credit card company's landing page. However, I don't think the first view and the rest of the landing page really fit together.
